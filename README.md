# fitimer

A timer to keep fit and healthy whilst having a sedentary working.

# Simplicity

You are either working or taking a break. So we have those two states in the real world. I used to use pomodoro timers for this, but this is simpler and has a nicer interface IMO.

# How it works

This is a TUI application with vim-like keybindigns.

# Todo

- [x] setup tui
- [ ] refactor main file
- [ ] replace all unwraps with expect with good error messages
- [ ] start timer

- [ ] toggle timer
- [ ] extend break

# Env vars

```bash
WORK_DURATION=25 # in mins
REST_DURATION=5 # in mins

```
